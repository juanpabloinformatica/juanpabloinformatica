## üßë‚Äçüíª About Me

I am a simple person, who is looking for hard challenges in software engineer domain.

I like uploading videos for having a knowledge tracking, in which I study and develop projects about computer architecture and algorithms, and 
time to time I work on sharpenning some tools such as linux coreutils and vim.

I am not interested in devops **(writting yamls files)**, only if is extending a certain tool, such a kubernetes csi drivers, controllers, and things that concerns understanding 
the lower layers of this technologies. 

## üöÄ Experience
**Eviden** - Echirolles, France
*Software Engineer*
*feb 2025 - Present*

- Ubuntu packing of a legacy C-based network monitoring switches project
- Infrastructure scripts, for testing switchtes with SONIC/NOS 

**Amadeus** - Villeneuve-Loubet, Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur, France  
*Software Engineer*   
*April 2024 - August 2024* 

- Developed Dockerfiles for containerizing projects and utilizing them as microservices.
- Created YAML files for CRD, CO, RBAC, and interacted with the Kubernetes API for real-time resource management.
- Developed a FUSE filesystem to retrieve a Git repository, update it upon detecting changes, and expose it via the filesystem.
- Developed a CSI driver to mount the FUSE filesystem as ephemeral volumes in Kubernetes pods.

**Tilvest** - Paris, France  
*Software Engineer*  
*May 2023 - Sep 2023*

- Developed a PDF generation system using HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript, integrating Handlebars for efficient document creation.
- Developed a Python automation script using Selenium and BeautifulSoup to extract partner data from the 'patrimonia.fr' website, saving them to a CSV file for analysis.
- Collaborated on the development of a Telegram bot, using Julia to generate XML files and implemented a Makefile to automate Docker operations.
- Dockerized applications, created Dockerfiles, and orchestrated services using Docker Compose for streamlined deployment processes.

## üìÇ Projects

- **Nand2tetris**: Individual Implementation of each project from nand2tetris self-taught course.
    Detailed description ‚Üí [Nand2tetris](https://github.com/juanpabloinformatica/nand2tetris))
  
  -**Part1: Hardware (DONE)**: I build a general-pourpose computer equipped with a symbolic machine languague and an assembler. I did step by step, all the implementation steps can be seem in my youtube channel. For the assembler I used c++, I am interested in lower-level languagues.


  -**Part2: Software (IN PROGRESS)**: I will build a multi-tier software hierarchy consisting of a virtual machine, a compiler for a simple java-like programming language, and a basic operating system.
  Currently I built the virtual machine, but the first part, now I am working in implementing the function call logic with a FIFO logic for saving stack frames and allow higher abstractions for the hack languague.
  
- **Multiplatform game (IN PROGRESS)**
    
    Game platform where people around the world can compete in different games, for the moment can be played the with multiplayer modality. Backend server  with websockets and broadcast circle positions that are rendered from the client
  Detailed description ‚Üí [Game platform](https://github.com/juanpabloinformatica/game_platform)


- **In-cluster Large Distribution**: Overcame the 1MB size limitation of configmap resource by implementing a FUSE filesystem injected through a CSI driver plugin for a pod that requests this filesystem.  
  [Detailed description](https://pfe-personal3710049-jppm-cs-b57ffe694a8206c0ab15aee00594890c095.gitlab.io/)

- **Distributed Application**: Developed robust blockchain transaction tracking software, leveraging microservices and Kubernetes orchestration on GCP. Ensured seamless deployment with Docker.

- **Werewolf Game**: Created a mobile Werewolf game following the MVC architecture and test-driven development with Cypress and Supertest. Developed in Node.js, Express, React Native, and SQLite, and deployed on Scalingo via a CI/CD pipeline using GitLab CI.
